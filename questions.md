# Section A: Interpretation & Clarification

## 13. How often do you use AI tools for your academic work?
- **Type:** Radio button
- **Options:**
    - Daily
    - Weekly
    - Occasionally
    - Rarely
    - Never

## 14. How did you first learn about these AI tools?
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

## 15. In your own words, summarise the core problem presented in the case in no more than 120 words. Your summary should clearly show:
a) The role of AI in students' academic performance, and
b) The concern about students' critical thinking.
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)
- **Max words:** 120

## 16. Explain what is meant by "peripheral higher education" in this context. How might "peripherality" shape both the adoption and the impact of AI tools in the sociology classroom?
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

---

# Section B: Analysis of Assumptions & Arguments

## 17. Identify three implicit assumptions made by university management when they interpret higher grades as evidence of "smart learning" success. For each assumption, explain why it may be problematic from a sociological perspective. (You may phrase as bullet points.)
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

## 18. A colleague argues: "AI is democratising knowledge. For peripheral universities, anything that raises grades is good. Critical thinking is a luxury; our students first need high marks to compete in the job market."
a) Reconstruct this argument in standard form (premises + conclusion).
b) Critically analyse the strengths and weaknesses of this argument using at least two sociological concepts (e.g., meritocracy, symbolic capital, neoliberalism, digital divide, hidden curriculum).
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

## 19. From the case, list three pieces of evidence and three opinions / interpretations (either by teachers, students, or management). Then explain how confusing evidence with opinion can mislead decision-making about AI policy in the department.
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

# Section C: Inference, Causal Reasoning & Alternative Explanations

## 20. Based on Table 1, what inferences can you reasonably draw about the relationship between AI use, academic performance, and critical thinking (as proxied by participation and confidence)?
Your answer should:
a) Identify at least two possible interpretations of the pattern (e.g., AI helps writing but weakens oral argument), and
b) Discuss at least one alternative explanation that does not blame AI alone.
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

## 21. Suppose you are asked to design a small empirical study within the department to test whether AI use is actually diminishing critical thinking among sociology students.
Briefly outline:
a) Your research question and hypothesis.
b) The key variables (at least one independent and one dependent variable; mention possible confounders).
c) Your basic design (e.g., comparison of AI users vs non-users, pre-test/post-test, mixed methods).
d) One ethical concern related to AI use in this research.
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)

# Section D: Self-Regulation & Meta-Reflection

## 22. Do you think your own learning in sociology would benefit more from:
a) Limited or no AI use, or
b) Guided / critical use of AI tools?

Choose one and justify your position in about 120–150 words, drawing on at least one sociological theory or concept (e.g., habitus, disciplinary power, rationalisation, McDonaldization, etc.).
- **Type:** Text box (long answer)
- **Word range:** 120–150 words

## 23. Briefly describe how you used AI during this test (or why you chose not to).
Evaluate:
a) In which question(s) did AI genuinely help your critical thinking, and
b) In which question(s) do you think AI may have weakened your independent thinking?

Be as honest and specific as possible.
